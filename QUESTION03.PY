"""
You are given a list of integers. Write a Python program to perform the following tasks:

Split into Even and Odd Lists: Separate the list into two new lists â€” one containing all the even numbers and the other containing all the odd numbers.
Sort Both Lists: Sort both the even and odd lists in descending order.
Merge the Lists: Merge the sorted even and odd lists back together, where all the even numbers appear before the odd numbers.
Calculate Product: Calculate the product of all numbers in the final merged list.
Example:

Input: [3, 6, 2, 7, 8, 5]

Output:

c
Product: 10080
